### Project Status :
##### Insert Operation: The insert operation is functioning correctly, allowing users to add new data to the JSONPowerDB database. Data validation ensures that only valid and properly formatted data is accepted.

##### Update Operation: The update operation is also working as intended, enabling users to modify existing data in the database while validating the changes to maintain data quality.

##### Data Validation: Your project includes data validation mechanisms, which help prevent errors and ensure that only valid data is entered or updated in the database.

##### Control Buttons: Three control buttons, namely "Reset," "Update," and "Save," are implemented to manage the insert and update operations effectively. These buttons are enabled and disabled based on the context of the operation, improving user experience and preventing unintended actions.
